## Reading Tips Using Epy

When reading using `epy` you might occasionally find triple asteriks `***`.
That means you reach the end of some section in your ebook
and the next line (right after those three asteriks, which is in new section)
will start at the top of the page.
This might be disorienting, so the best way to get seamless reading experience
is by using next-page control (`space`, `l` or `Right`)
instead of next-line control (`j` or `Down`).

If you really want to get seamless reading experience, you can set `SeamlessBetweenChapters`
to `true` in configuration file. But it has its drawback with more memory usage, that's why
it's disabled by default.

## Configuration File

Config file is available in json format which is located at:

- Linux and Mac OS: `~/.config/epy/configuration.json` or `~/.epy/configuration.json`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.epy\configuration.json`

## URL Support

You can read online books like: short stories, fan fiction, etc. using `epy` with an url as cli argument.
Pretty useful when you want to read with less distraction.
`epy` will also remember your reading progress online.

eg. You can read [Moby Dick from gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm)
directly with:

```shell
$ epy https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm
```

But note that `epy` will never be a web browser, it's simply a TUI program to read
your favorite fiction stories in the comfort of a terminal.
So please do not expect for web browser features to be implemented in `epy`.

## Using Mouse

Although mouse support is useful when running `epy` on Termux Android, itâ€™s disabled by default
since most people find it intrusive when using `epy` in desktop.
But you can enable it by setting `MouseSupport` to `true` in config file.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Left Click` (right side of screen) | next page |
| `Left Click` (left side of screen) | prev page |
| `Right Click` | ToC |
| `Scroll Up` | scroll up |
| `Scroll Down` | scroll down |
| `Ctrl` + `Scroll Up` | increase text width |
| `Ctrl` + `Scroll Down` | decrease text width |

## Text-to-Speech

To get Text-to-Speech (TTS) support, external TTS engine is necessary.

List of supported engines:

- `mimic`
- `pico2wave`

## Dictionary

To use "Define Word" you will have to install an external dictionary cli program (`sdcv`, `dict` or `wkdict`). After you've done that, it is recommended to manually modify the configuration.json file, and set your desired dictionary there, so everything works properly.

After that you will be able to find definition of word by pressing `d`, and aprompt will appear to let you type in word to define.

## Double Spread

Double spread is intended to mimic the behaviour of real book,
so line scrolling navigation will act as scrolling page and textwidth is not adjustable.

## Changelog

- `v2021.10.23`: Major refactoring which harness a lot of new stuff in `python>=3.7`
  and `epy` won't be backward compatible with older python version and older configuration.

- `v2022.1.8`: Change in configuration and reading states schema that is not backward compatible.
  So if error is encountered, deleting the configuration and states file might fix the issue.

- `v2022.1.15`: Early implementation of URL support, table of contents isn't available for now.

- `v2022.1.23`: Library implementation: ability to switch ebook from reading history
  inside epy (default key: `R`).

- `v2022.2.5`: Fix process.join() issue for unstarted process.

- `v2022.10.2`: Major breakdown `epy.py` module into package structure for easier development.
